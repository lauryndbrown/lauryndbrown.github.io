# Lauryn Brown's Personal Website

## Purpose
A simple, personal portfolio and blog to share my programming journey with the world.

## Tools used
* Jekyll is used for blogging
* [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Scrolling Nav](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/scrolling-nav/) is used as a base for scrolling nav. Though there were several changes necessary to ensure it was responsive. It does not appear currently maintained.
